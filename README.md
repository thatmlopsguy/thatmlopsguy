## 👋 About me

Cloud Architect, {Dev/ML}Ops & Platform Engineer engineer with over `10 years of experience` designing and developing practical intelligent systems.

Enthusiastic about the DevOps culture and focused on Open Source technologies. My current focus is modern cloud infrastructure - I remove roadblocks and get teams back into productive flow.

Today I design highly automated, secure, and scalable cloud and container platforms that let development teams concentrate fully on their core product.
